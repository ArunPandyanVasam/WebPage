                    Angkor Wat remained open throughout most of the COVID-19 pandemic, only closing for a few weeks during Cambodia's very brief lockdowns. Visitor numbers plummeted by 99% between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021 as international visitors stayed away due to strict quarantine policies on arrival.

                <h3>Temple etiquette</h3>
                <p>As the temples of Angkor represent a sacred religious site to the Khmer people, visitors are asked to dress modestly. It is not possible to visit the highest level of Angkor Wat without upper arms covered and shorts to the knees. Local authorities have visitor “code of conduct” guidelines and a video to encourage appropriate dress, as well as reminding tourists not to touch, sit or climb on the ancient structures, to pay attention to restricted areas, and to be respectful of monks.</p>

                <h2>What is Angkor Wat?</h2>
                <p>Angkor Wat built by Suryavarman II  is the earthly representation of Mount Meru, the Mount Olympus of the Hindu faith, and the abode of ancient gods. The Cambodian god-kings of old each strove to better their ancestors structures in size, scale, and symmetry, culminating in what is believed to be the worlds largest religious building.</p>
                <p>The temple is the heart and soul of Cambodia and a source of fierce national pride. Unlike the other Angkor monuments, it was never abandoned to the elements and has been in virtually continuous use since it was built.</p>    
                <h2>How was Angkor Wat built?</h2>
                <p>The sandstone blocks from which Angkor Wat was built were quarried from the holy mountain of Phnom Kulen, more than 50km (31mi) away, and floated down the Siem Reap River on rafts. The logistics of such an operation are mind-blowing, consuming the labor of thousands. According to inscriptions, the construction of Angkor Wat involved 300,000 workers and 6000 elephants. It was not fully completed.</p>
